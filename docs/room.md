## **Properties**

### **name**

Returns the name of the room.

### **capacity**

### **capacity**

A setter property that allows you to set a new max capacity for the room. If the new capacity is lower than the current number of players in the room, an error will be thrown so it's recommended to wrap this in a try catch.
