# GameGuard Client

The GameGuard client doesn't offer as much as the server at this moment but it can be used to listen to events and respond to them accordingly.

## **Initialization**

To initialize the client, use:

```js
// Browser
import GameGuardClient from 'node_modules/gameguard/gameguardclient.js';

const ggc = new GameGuardClient();

ggc.on('open', (playerId) => {

  // playerId is the id that was created for the player.
  console.log(playerId);

});

ggc.on('message', (message) => {

  // The message object contains the type of message and the contents of the message.
  console.log(message.type, message.content);

});

ggc.on('close', (reason) => {

  // reason contains the reason that the connection was closed, if one was provided server side.
  console.log(reason);

});
```
